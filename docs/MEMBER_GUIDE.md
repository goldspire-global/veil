# Veil — member guide

Quick start for **Veil by Goldspire** in Outlook, Gmail, and the web.

**Admin setup?** Your IT owner should follow [ADMIN_GUIDE.md](ADMIN_GUIDE.md).  
**Install links:** [Veil install page](https://veil.goldspireventures.com/install.html)

> Screenshots: [docs/screenshots/](screenshots/README.md) — visual walkthrough below.

## Install & join

1. Install Veil (from your IT catalog or install page your admin shared)
2. Click the Veil icon → choose **Team**
3. Enter **join code** and **work email** from your admin
4. Save the **team passphrase** when prompted
5. **Refresh** your Outlook or Gmail tab (F5)

Check the popup **Home** tab — the setup checklist should be all green.

## Secure a secret

| Method | What to do |
|--------|------------|
| **Paste** | Paste sensitive text → Veil copilot modal → Secure / Mask / Tokenize |
| **Highlight** | Select text → Veil bar appears → choose an action |
| **Shortcut** | Highlight → `Ctrl+Shift+S` to secure as `[redacted]` |

When you **paste** a secret into compose, Veil shows a copilot modal before the text lands in the message:

**Smart copilot** stays quiet while you type name, email, or date of birth on signup forms — but still catches API keys and other secrets.

## Unlock received content

- Click `[redacted]` or `[veil:vt_…]` in the email
- Enter team passphrase if asked
- Use **Re-lock** or wait for auto re-lock when done

## Tokenize (team email)

**Tokenize** replaces text with `[veil:vt_…]`. Teammates in the same org click to reveal. Works across Outlook and Gmail if both have Veil installed and joined.
